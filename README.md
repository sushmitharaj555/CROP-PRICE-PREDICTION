# CROP-PRICE-PREDICTION
It is a ML project to predict the Crop price based on some features.

Goal: Use machine learning to predict future prices of a specific crop in a particular timeframe and location.

Steps:
Define scope: Choose a crop, season, and location.
Data collection: Downloading a dataset from kaggle with relevant factors.
Data preprocessing: Clean, format, and engineer features from collected data.
Model selection and training: Choose and train suitable ML models.
Model evaluation and deployment: Evaluate on unseen data, consider interpretability and efficiency, and deploy for prediction use.
