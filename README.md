# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION
It is a ML project to predict the Crop yield based on some features.

Goal: The goal of crop yield prediction is to forecast the expected output or production of crops within a specific region or area over a defined period.

Steps:
Data Collection : Gathering various types of information related to crops.
     Data Preprocessing : Getting the data ready for analysis by cleaning and organizing.
     Feature Selection : Streamline the data and focus on the most important factors.
     Model Selection : Select a right machine learning algorithm to predict crop yield.
     Model Training : Training the Selected model based on your data.
     Model Evaluation : Evaluation is about checking how well your trained model performs.
     Deployment : Putting your prediction tool to work in the real world.
     Maintenance : Maintaining the model.
